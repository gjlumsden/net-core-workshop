### Steps

1. Create a new ASP.NET Web Application using .NET Framework in Visual Studio.

2. Following the steps of [this tutorial](hthttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/proper-to-2x/?view=aspnetcore-3.1), see if you can port the application to ASP.NET Core 3.1. The tutorial covers the following steps:

    * Prerequisites
    * Target Frameworks
    * Project structure differences
    * Global.asax file replacement
    * Storing Configurations
    * Native Dependency Injection
    * Serving Static Files
    * Additional Resources

    > **Note:** You might not have time to complete the port in the time allotted. The important part is to understand the overall steps involved, not to complete the port.
